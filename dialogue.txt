GO FISH! 
=RULES=
Go Fish uses a standard 52 card deck. 
In this game we will only focus on the card values.
For Example : A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K
1. Each player will be given five cards.
2. On your turn ask any player for a card. For Example:
	"Give me your Kings"
	If the player asked has any "Kings" they give you all their kings.
	Otherwise, They say "Go Fish!" and...
	you draw a card from the pile.
3. Once you have 4 of a kind, you make a "book".
	Put these "book" aside, they are out of play now.
4. If you happen to run out of cards, you take a card out of the pile.
	And continue your turn as normal. 
	If there is no more cards in the pile, You are out of the game.
5. Once every player's hand is empty, the game is over.
	The player with the most books win!
